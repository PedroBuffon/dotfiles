Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.

Sounds boring. Let's try again.

**Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one.**

Once installed, your terminal shell will become the talk of the town _or your money back!_ With each keystroke in your command prompt, you'll take advantage of the hundreds of powerful plugins and beautiful themes. Strangers will come up to you in caf√©s and ask you, _"that is amazing! are you some sort of genius?"_

Finally, you'll begin to get the sort of attention that you have always felt you deserved. ...or maybe you'll use the time that you're saving to start flossing more often. üò¨

### Prerequisites

- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) should be installed (v4.3.9 or more recent is fine but we prefer 5.0.8 and newer). If not pre-installed (run `zsh --version` to confirm), check the following wiki instructions here: [Installing ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
- `curl` or `wget` should be installed
- `git` should be installed (recommended v2.4.11 or higher)

### Basic Installation

Oh My Zsh is installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal. You can install this via the command-line with either `curl`, `wget` or another similar tool.

| Method    | Command                                                                                           |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **curl**  | `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"` |
| **wget**  | `sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`   |
| **fetch** | `sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"` |

Alternatively, the installer is also mirrored outside GitHub. Using this URL instead may be required if you're in a country like India or China, that blocks `raw.githubusercontent.com`:

| Method    | Command                                                                                           |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **curl**  | `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://install.ohmyz.sh/)"`                                                 |
| **wget**  | `sh -c "$(wget -O- https://install.ohmyz.sh/)"`                                                   |
| **fetch** | `sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://install.ohmyz.sh/)"`                                                 |

_Note that any previous `.zshrc` will be renamed to `.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh`. After installation, you can move the configuration you want to preserve into the new `.zshrc`._

#### Manual Inspection

It's a good idea to inspect the install script from projects you don't yet know. You can do
that by downloading the install script first, looking through it so everything looks normal,
then running it:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh
sh install.sh
```

If the above URL times out or otherwise fails, you may have to substitute the URL for `https://install.ohmyz.sh` to be able to get the script.
